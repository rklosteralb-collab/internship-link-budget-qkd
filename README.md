Internship report: link budget and qubits-per-second estimation for QKD

# Internship Report — Link Budget & QKD

This repository hosts the **internship report** where I analyzed an optical **link budget** and produced an order-of-magnitude estimate of **qubits per second** for **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** scenarios.

## Why only the report?
I currently don’t have access to the original MATLAB scripts (toolbox versions and files were on a different machine), so I’m publishing the report to document the work and results. If I recover or rewrite the code, I’ll add it here under `/code`.
